This is a completely free and open-source project, but it is difficult to maintain without incentives and contributions from the community.

If you think this project is helpful, consider giving it a star [![GitHub Repo stars]][Github Repo], it would be very helpful for my work and studies. 🥺👉👈

## Features

> **TL;DR**
>
> You are hurry and just wanna see/run the demo? See [examples/tauri-app](https://github.com/pytauri/pytauri/tree/main/examples/tauri-app).

[notification]: https://docs.rs/tauri-plugin-notification/latest/tauri_plugin_notification/

- Need Rust compiler, but **almost don't need to write Rust code**!
- Or use `pytauri-wheel`, **you won't need the Rust compiler, everything can be done in Python**! Check out [examples/tauri-app-wheel](https://github.com/pytauri/pytauri/tree/main/examples/tauri-app-wheel).
- Can be integrated with `tauri-cli` to build and package standalone executables!
- No IPC (inter-process communication) overhead, secure and fast, thanks to [Pyo3]!
- Support Tauri official plugins(e.g., [notification]), and you can write your own plugins!

    ![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14ad5b51-b333-4d80-b04b-af72c4179571)

- Natively support async python (`asyncio`, `trio` or `anyio`)
- **100%** [Type Completeness](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/typed-libraries?id=type-completeness)
- Ergonomic API (and as close as possible to the Tauri Rust API)
    - Python

        ```python
        import sys

        from pydantic import BaseModel
        from pytauri import (
            AppHandle,
            Commands,
        )
        from pytauri_plugin_notification import NotificationExt

        commands: Commands = Commands()


        class Person(BaseModel):
            name: str


        class Greeting(BaseModel):
            message: str


        @commands.command()
        async def greet(body: Person, app_handle: AppHandle) -> Greeting:
            notification_builder = NotificationExt.builder(app_handle)
            notification_builder.show(title="Greeting", body=f"Hello, {body.name}!")

            return Greeting(
                message=f"Hello, {body.name}! You've been greeted from Python {sys.version}!"
            )
        ```

    - Frontend

        ```ts
        import { pyInvoke } from "tauri-plugin-pytauri-api";
        // or: `const { pyInvoke } = window.__TAURI__.pytauri;`

        export interface Person {
            name: string;
        }

        export interface Greeting {
            message: string;
        }

        export async function greet(body: Person): Promise<Greeting> {
            return await pyInvoke("greet", body);
        }
        ```

- Can be integrated with [nicegui]/[gradio]/[FastAPI] to achieve a full-stack Python development experience (i.g., without `Node.js`). See [examples/nicegui-app](https://github.com/pytauri/pytauri/tree/main/examples/nicegui-app).

## Release

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

Rust and its Python bindings, PyTauri core and its plugins will keep the same `MAJOR.MINOR` version number.

## Philosophy

### For Pythoneer

I hope `PyTauri` can become an alternative to [pywebview] and [Pystray], leveraging Tauri's comprehensive features to offer Python developers a GUI framework and a batteries-included development experience similar to [electron] and [PySide].

> PyTauri is inspired by [FastAPI] and [Pydantic], aiming to offer a similar development experience.

### For Rustacean

Through [Pyo3], I hope Rust developers can better utilize the Python ecosystem (e.g., building AI GUI applications with [PyTorch]).

Although Rust's lifetime and ownership system makes Rust code safer, Python's garbage collection (GC) will make life easier. 😆

## Used By

Although PyTauri is a fairly young project, a few people have used it to make cool projects:

- [Digger Solo](https://solo.digger.lol/) - AI powered file manager
